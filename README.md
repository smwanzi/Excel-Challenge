# Excel-Challenge
# Background
Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.
Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. 

## Goal
The goal of the assignment was to organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

Used an Excel table to modify and analyze the data of 4,000 past Kickstarter projects. 

Used conditional formatting to fill each cell in the Percent Funded column using a three-color scale. 

Created a new column P called Average Donation that uses a formula to uncover how much each backer for the project paid on average.

Created two new columns, one called Category at Q and another called Sub-Category at R, which use formulas to split the Category and Sub-Category column into two parts.

Created a new sheet with a pivot table that analyzes the initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per category.

Created a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country based on the created table.

Created a new sheet with a pivot table that analyzes the initial sheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, or canceled, or are currently live per sub-category.

Created a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent-category based on the table.

Converted the Unix timestamps (dates) stored within the deadline and launched_at columns to normal dates.

Created line graph, Bar graph and a pie chart that visualize this the information in the created table.

Performed a statistical analysis on the data and created a summary statistics table to quantify the results of the analysis.
